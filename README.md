# Extra-Credit
Creates N-grams of a .txt collection

This was an extra credit assignment that was a rework of an earlier homework assignment where we built Tries 
with selected texts.

Then outputted a random paragraph in the "style" of the selected works.

This reworking with another tool is made easier to write with the zip() Python method.
